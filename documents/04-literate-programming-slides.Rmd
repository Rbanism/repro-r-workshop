# Motivating literate programming

## Why R Markdown?

<div class=columns-2>
- R Markdown allows you to **seamlessly combine executable R code, its output, and text** in a single document. 
- These documents **can be converted to multiple static and dynamic output formats**, including PDF (.pdf), Word (.docx), and HTML (.html).
- The benefit of a well-prepared R Markdown document is **full reproducibility**.

## Demo

- Open `documents/countryPick4.Rmd`

- Scroll down until you see the following code chunk:
```{r}
countryName1 <- "India"
countryName2 <- "United States"
countryName3 <- "Nigeria"
countryName4 <- "Germany"
```

- Replace the country names within the quotation marks with any country of your choice, using the exact name from the list of countries shown on the presentation screen.

- Knit the document

- See how the report generated all results for the countries you chose

# Now let's create an Rmd report from scratch
