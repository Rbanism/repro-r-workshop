-   Reproducibility has been a concern primarily in the quantitative sciences

-   Mostly of interest in quantitative urban planning, urban studies, and urban morphometrics

    BUT

-   Urbanism and all its sub-fields are increasingly data-driven. If we cannot keep the pace with this trend, we risk ending up in a legitimacy crisis

-   Urbanism is neither purely qualitative nor purely quantitative. It is to a large extent mixed.

    -   qual & quan - not black & white, either/or, but a continuum/gradient in a domain that is mostly mixed; this requires a better understanding of the gradient, a more critical and less superficial use of data

## Context

### Open Science

-   FAIR data and software

### Rbanism

-   a community activation project

## Concerns

-   design

-   ethics

## A reproducible project

-   Clear and detailed descriptions of:

    -   steps taken with data and metadata

        -   reproducible spreadsheets in open formats

        -   metadata in README files

        -   keep raw data

        -   minimising manual retreival and modifications of data

    -   the workflow

    -   environment/context

## Outlook

-   to raise awareness, reproducibility self-assessment could be included in our theses

## Further learning

-   version control was not covered

-   resources

-   R Cafe
